- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js v5 (Auth.js) with Google OAuth
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 (via @aws-sdk/client-s3)
- **UI**: shadcn/ui (Radix UI + Tailwind)
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod

# Coding Guidelines

## General

- Use **TypeScript** for all code.
- Prefer **Functional Components** with hooks.
- Use **Server Components** by default. Only add `"use client"` when interactivity (state, effects, event listeners) is strictly required.
- **Strict Mode**: Ensure no console errors or linter warnings.
- Follow modern JavaScript/TypeScript best practices (ES6+).

## Next.js & React

- Use the **App Router** structure (`app/`).
- Use **Server Actions** for data mutations.
- Use `next/image` for optimized image rendering.
- Use `next/link` for client-side navigation.
- Implement `Suspense` boundaries for async data fetching components.
- Utilize React 19 features (like `useActionState`, `useFormStatus`, etc.) where appropriate.

## Styling (Tailwind CSS v4)

- Use standard Tailwind utility classes.
- Use `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` (via a `cn` helper) for conditional class names.
- Ensure responsiveness using Tailwind's breakpoint prefixes (mobile-first approach).
- Keep CSS variables for theming if applicable.

## Animation (Framer Motion)

- Use **Framer Motion** for complex animations and page transitions.
- Prefer the `motion` component primitives (e.g., `motion.div`).
- Use `AnimatePresence` for exit animations.
- Keep animations performant; prefer transforming `opacity` and `transform`.

## Database (MongoDB/Mongoose)

- Define robust Mongoose schemas and models.
- Ensure all database operations handle errors gracefully.
- Use a singleton connection pattern for MongoDB to prevent connection exhaustion in serverless environments.

## Authentication (NextAuth.js v5)

- Use `auth.ts` for configuration (providers, callbacks, adapters).
- Use the **MongoDB Adapter** for persistent session storage.
- Implement **Google OAuth** as a primary provider.
- Protect routes using Middleware or server-side session checks (`auth()`).

## File Storage (AWS S3)

- Use `@aws-sdk/client-s3` for file operations.
- Store sensitive credentials (keys, bucket names, regions) in environment variables.
- Generate signed URLs for secure file access/upload where appropriate, or proxy through API routes.

## UI Components (shadcn/ui)

- Reuse existing UI components whenever possible.
- If a new primitive is needed, install it via shadcn CLI or create it following the same pattern (Radix UI + Tailwind).
- Keep components small, focused, and composable.

## Forms & Validation

- Use **React Hook Form** for form state management.
- Use **Zod** for schema validation (both client-side and server-side).

## Architecture & patterns

- Maintain a clear separation of concerns.
- Colocate components with their routes if they are specific to that route, or in a shared `components/` directory if reusable.
- Use environment variables for configuration.
